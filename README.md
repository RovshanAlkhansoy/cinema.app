I actually didn't have enough time to do my best in this project as I was working full time in my current job, 
I started this project from the very beginning and I want to have all the features and functions without launching 
the app. If I were to take a running application and make it fully functional, I wouldn't even get to half of the 
features and functionality of this project. I took into account all the requirements attached to the task file and 
I thought that the coding style and the completeness of the project are very important, any errors or problems that 
may occur can be solved, but from my point of view what is more important is the possible requirements. I could have 
time for the project on Saturday and Sunday, but I was able to spare half a day on Sunday due to the wedding of a very
close friend. In addition, it should be noted that since it is the end of the quarter, there is a lot of work at my 
current place of work and the deadline is very close. This prevented me from aligning to this project in the way 
I wanted.

It would be great if coding ability, clean code and all possible functionality were considered, because that's the way
I approached it and put all my efforts in that direction.
